# (Make sure you are in the main 'daba-fing-project' directory)
# If you created the Vite frontend-web folder, remove it first:
# rm -rf frontend-web  # On macOS/Linux
# rmdir /s /q frontend-web # On Windows

# 1. Create the Next.js project using the official installer
npx create-next-app@latest frontend-web

# 2. You will be asked several questions. Here are recommended answers:
#    ✔ Would you like to use TypeScript? ... Yes
#    ✔ Would you like to use ESLint? ... Yes
#    ✔ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? ... Yes  <-- IMPORTANT! Select Yes here.
#    ✔ Would you like to use `src/` directory? ... Yes
#    ✔ Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) ... Yes
#    ✔ Would you like to customize the default import alias? ... No (or Yes if you have a preference)
#    (Wait for the installation to complete)

# 3. Navigate into your new frontend project directory
cd frontend-web

# 4. Install Axios for making API calls
npm install axios

# 5. Verify the setup
npm run dev
#    Open your web browser to the URL provided (usually http://localhost:3000).
#    You should see the default Next.js starter page.
#    Since you selected Tailwind during setup, it's already configured.
#    Try editing `src/app/page.tsx` and adding/modifying Tailwind classes
#    (e.g., className="text-xl text-blue-600") to confirm it's working.
#    Stop the server with Ctrl+C.

# 6. Check .gitignore: `create-next-app` usually generates a good .gitignore file
#    It should already include node_modules/, .next/, .env*. Make sure it does.
