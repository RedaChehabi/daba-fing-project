  - Central Pocket Loop: Loop with whorl in center
  - Double Loop: Two separate loop formations
- **Arch (5% of population)**
  - Plain Arch: Simple wave pattern
  - Tented Arch: Arch with upward thrust

#### Confidence Score
- **90-100%**: Excellent quality, high reliability
- **80-89%**: Good quality, reliable results
- **70-79%**: Acceptable quality, moderate reliability
- **Below 70%**: Poor quality, results may be unreliable

#### Quality Metrics
- **Image Clarity**: Sharpness and focus assessment
- **Ridge Definition**: Clarity of ridge patterns
- **Noise Level**: Presence of artifacts or distortions
- **Completeness**: Percentage of fingerprint captured

#### Minutiae Points
- **Ridge Endings**: Points where ridges terminate
- **Bifurcations**: Points where ridges split
- **Dots**: Very short ridges
- **Islands**: Short ridges surrounded by valleys

### Interpreting Results
