## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Code Review**: All code changes require security review
2. **Dependency Management**: Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning
3. **Secure Coding**: Follow OWASP secure coding guidelines
4. **Environment Variables**: Never commit secrets to version control
5. **Testing**: Include security testing in development workflow

### For Users
1. **Strong Passwords**: Use strong, unique passwords for accounts
2. **Software Updates**: Keep applications updated to latest versions
3. **Network Security**: Use secure networks for sensitive operations
4. **Data Backup**: Regularly backup important analysis data
5. **Access Control**: Limit access to authorized personnel only

### For Administrators
1. **Regular Updates**: Apply security updates promptly
2. **Access Monitoring**: Monitor user access and activity logs
3. **Backup Security**: Ensure backups are encrypted and secure
4. **Network Configuration**: Implement proper firewall and network security
5. **Incident Response**: Have incident response procedures in place

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### How to Report
If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Email**: Send details to security@dabafing.com
2. **Subject**: Use "Security Vulnerability Report" in the subject line
3. **Details**: Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if known)

### What to Include
- **Component**: Which part of the system is affected
- **Severity**: Your assessment of the vulnerability severity
- **Environment**: Development, staging, or production
- **Evidence**: Screenshots, logs, or proof-of-concept (if safe)

### Response Timeline
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Status Updates**: Weekly until resolution
- **Fix Deployment**: Based on severity (critical: 24-48 hours)

## Security Incident Response

### Incident Classification
- **Critical**: Immediate threat to user data or system integrity
- **High**: Significant security risk requiring urgent attention
- **Medium**: Security issue requiring timely resolution
- **Low**: Minor security concern for future consideration

### Response Process
1. **Detection**: Identify and confirm security incident
2. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems and prevent spread
3. **Investigation**: Analyze the incident and determine impact
4. **Eradication**: Remove the threat and fix vulnerabilities
5. **Recovery**: Restore systems and monitor for recurrence
6. **Lessons Learned**: Document and improve security measures

## Compliance & Standards

### Standards Followed
- **OWASP Top 10**: Web application security risks mitigation
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Security framework implementation
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management principles
- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy compliance (where applicable)

### Regular Security Activities

- **Penetration Testing**: Regular third-party security assessments
- **Code Audits**: Security-focused code reviews
- **Security Training**: Regular team security awareness training

## Data Privacy

### Data Collection
- **Minimal Collection**: Only collect necessary data for functionality
- **Purpose Limitation**: Use data only for stated purposes
- **Consent**: Obtain proper consent for data collection and processing
- **Retention**: Implement data retention and deletion policies

### Data Processing
- **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest
