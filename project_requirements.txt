DabaFing: A Desktop, Web, and Mobile Application for Fingerprint
Classification and Ridge Counting in Fingerprints Using
Reinforcement Learning
This document outlines the requirements and specifications for the development of a cross-
platform application (desktop, web, and mobile) that leverages Interactive Reinforcement
Learning (IRL) or Learning from Human Feedback (LHF) to classify and count ridges in
fingerprint images. The application will incorporate human feedback to improve the model's
accuracy and adaptability over time, providing a dynamic and user-centric solution for
fingerprint analysis.
1. Objectives
• Develop an Interactive Reinforcement Learning (IRL) or Learning from Human
Feedback (LHF) model capable of accurately classifying and counting ridges in
fingerprint images.
• Create a seamless user experience across desktop, web, and mobile platforms.
• Enable users to provide feedback to refine the model's performance iteratively.
• Ensure high performance, scalability, and security of the application.
• Provide an intuitive interface for users to upload, process, and analyze fingerprint
images.
2. Functional Requirements
2.1. Core Features
1- 2- 3- 4- Fingerprint Image Upload: Allow users to upload fingerprint images in maximum
possible formats (e.g., JPEG, JPG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, TIF, WebP, PDF) either from
biometric sensor, smartphone camera, or from paper with inked fingerprint images.
Preprocessing: Automatically preprocess images (e.g., noise reduction,
normalization) before analysis.
Merging capability: Integrate the capability for merging left, middle, and right
parts of a fingerprint to form a more complete fingerprint.

o Train and deploy a model that adapts based on user feedback.
o Allow users to correct or validate the model's predictions (e.g., ridge count,
classification).
o Continuously update the model using feedback to improve accuracy.
5- Analysis Results:
o Display original image and ridge feature-enhanced image
o Provide a visual overlay highlighting ridges on the fingerprint image.
o Generate fingerprint classification report.
o Display the number of ridges detected.
6- Feedback Mechanism:
o Enable users to provide feedback on the accuracy of results.
o Allow users to annotate or correct ridge counts and classifications.
7- Export Results: Allow users to export results in PDF, CSV, or image formats.
2.2 User Management
• Authentication: Secure login and registration for users.
• Role-Based Access: Differentiate between admin and standard user roles.
• User Profiles: Allow users to manage their profiles and view analysis history.
2.3. Platform-Specific Features
• Desktop Application:
o Offline functionality for image processing.
o High-performance processing for large datasets.
• Web Application:
o Responsive design for compatibility with various devices and browsers.
o Cloud-based storage for user data and analysis results.
• Mobile Application:
o Camera integration for direct fingerprint image capture.
o Lightweight and optimized for mobile processing.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
3.1. Performance
• The application should process and analyze fingerprint images within 5 seconds for
standard resolutions.
• The model should achieve an initial accuracy of at least 93%, improving over time
with user feedback.

3.2. Scalability
• The application should handle at least 1,000 concurrent users on the web platform.
• The backend should support scaling for increased data storage and processing
demands.
3.3. Security
• Implement encryption for data transmission and storage.
• Ensure compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
• Regularly update the application to address security vulnerabilities.
3.4. Usability
• Provide a clean and intuitive user interface.
• Include tooltips, tutorials, and documentation for ease of use.
• Ensure accessibility for users with disabilities.
4. Technical Specifications
4.1. Technology Stack
• Frontend: React.js (web), Electron (desktop), React Native (mobile).
• Backend: Python with Fast API or Flask/Django; or Node.js with Express.js.
• Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for user data, feedback, and analysis history.
• Interactive Reinforcement Learning Framework: TensorFlow, PyTorch, or
OpenAI Gym with human-in-the-loop integration.
• Cloud Services: AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for hosting, storage, and model
training.
4.2 Feedback Integration
• Reward Function Modification: Use libraries like Stable Baselines3 (SB3) or RLlib
to modify the reward function dynamically.
• Natural Language Processing (NLP): Use pre-trained models like BERT or
RoBERTa to process textual feedback.
4.3 Model Updates
• Incremental Learning: Implement techniques like Elastic Weight Consolidation
(EWC) or Experience Replay to allow the model to learn continuously without
forgetting previous knowledge.
• Transfer Learning: Fine-tune a pre-trained model on new data provided by experts.

4.4 User and Expert Interfaces
• Develop a web-based dashboard where users input their feedbacks regarding the
model predictions, and allow experts to validate or correct them. Allow experts also
to upload images, view predictions, and provide feedback.
4.5. Integration
• Use APIs for cross-platform synchronization and data sharing.
• Implement feedback loops to update the model in real-time or periodically.
4.6. Deployment
